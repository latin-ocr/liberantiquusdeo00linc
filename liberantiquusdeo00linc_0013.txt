their members at times from the monastery, and performing divine
offices at the several churches.’' The cures were often scandalously
neglected, and the fabrics of the churches fell into decay. To
remedy this it was enacted by the Council of Westminster, 1102,
“That monks do not accept of churches without the Bishop’s
consent, nor so rob those which are given them of their revenues
that the priests who serve them be in want of necessaries.'' In
cures where the monastery was distant it was often of course
necessary to employ a secular priest, but these, as it appears, were
very scantily paid. In spite of the difficulties created for them by
this Canon the monks continued to obtain donations of churches‚
the number of which in England eventually amounted to 3,845
when the whole of the livings were computed at 9,284. N unneries‚
the military orders, Cathedral Churches, and Bishops, all seized
upon the parochial churches and exacted the tithes, leaving the
parishioners often to fare but badly. In 1173 Archbishop Richard
published a constitution, “Nullus presumat intrare ecclesiam absque
presentatione advocati ecclesiae, et impersonatione diocesani episcopi
vel officialis ejus per ipsum,'' and in 1179 the Lateran Council
under Alexander III. ordained that the Bishops were to require the
monastery to assign to the Vicar a sum sufficient for paying the
episcopal dues and enjoying an honest maintenance, and that Vicars
were not to be removable or their stipends alterable at the will of
the appropriator or rector. This Canon, however, was steadily
resisted by the English monasterieS, which constantly refused any
perpetual alienation of the tithes and dues to a vicar, but preferred
to treat him simply as their curate removable at their will. The
Bishops of Lincoln made some attempts to carry out the law ,·
St. Hugh established the Vicarage of Swinford, in the County of
Leicester, before 1200, and William de BloiS, soon after his accession
to the See, established that of Pullokeshull. The Council of
Westminster, held ΑΛ). 1200, under Archbishop Hubert Walter,
enforced the Lateran canon by directing “ all the religious to present
priests to the bishops for the churches which they hold not by an
absolute right, who shall be answerable to the bishops for the care of
the peop1e‚ and accountable to the religious for the temporals.’'
