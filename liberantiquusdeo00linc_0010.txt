Letters were sealed and forwarded by a clerk, who was then acting
as the deputy of the Chaneellor, Walter de Grey, and whose name
θ was Hugh Troteman. He was brother to J oselin, Bishop of Bath
and Wells, one of the King's Bishops, and he himself held the
office of Archdeacon of Wells. Having a brother so reliable, and
being himself so ready to work actively in the king's service, John
never doubted of Hugh that he would make a useful and compliant
prelate, and when, by and by, it became necessary for the King to
strengthen his episcopal following, and he had made up his mind

of York was practically vacant. The other Bishops were afraid to

brought into a state of complete antagonism to the King, and had
to remain abroad with the other Bishops until peace was made
between the Pope and King John. The King once more seized
upon the revenues of the See of Linooln, It was not till July,
1210, that Bishop Hugh was able, in company with the Primate
and the other Bishops, to return to England. John, however,
appeared now ready to shower favours upon 13116 Bishop. A large
