to the Diocese of Lincoln, of which 15‚000 marks were paid.* The
rent of eight pounds for the Stow Fair was remitted 3 the manor of
Wilsthorpe was given to the Church for the annual payment of
twenty pounds. Hugh, together with the other Bishops, had granted
to him the right of holding the courts in all his mauors, and of
treating his woods as being under the forest laws. The King
writes to Roger de N evile to restore to the Bishop the money
received from the Abbey of Eynsham. He bids Briau de Insula
furnish him with 300 stags for Stow Park. He writes to the

the unhappy Jews to such straits that the centra] government was
obliged to interfere to help them. On other occasions the royal
clemency was extended to offenders in the Bishop's prisons.† The
monasteries which had appropriated parish churches were not now
likely to find much favour at his hands. The monkish historian
