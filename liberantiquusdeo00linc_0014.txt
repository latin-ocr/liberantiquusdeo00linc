X. LIBER ANTIQUUS HUGONIS WELLS.

Diocese being practically without a Bishop from 1206 to 1213—
prevented the effectual enforcement of this canon, but when Hugh
de Wells came to his See in 1213 he must have stirred vigorously
and at once in the matter, for the book which follows was written,
for the most part, as it appears, in 1218, and it contains the record
01 1110 establishment 01 nearly 300 Vicarages. The method pursued
in allotting Vicarages was as follows :—An inquisition was made
in the Chapters 01 1110 Rural Deans into the value 01 1110 Rectories
and the competent portion to be assigned to the Vicarages. A
return was then made to the Bishop, who was to approve and
confirm the acts of the Chapters, or to alter them as he thought fit 3
then the allotment was entered in the Bishop's register. The
amount usually assigned to the Vicar was about one-third ot} the
profits of the benefice, derived from the altar dues and tithes 3 as
well as a house, and some glebe. He had to bear some part of the
onera incident to ecclesiastical benefices. His salary very commonly
amounted to five or six marks. The monastery was also often
charged to provide him an assistant. But the numerous and very
curious variations in the provisions 101 1110 Vicars will best be
j udged from the following pages. The establishment of Vicarages
was greatly aided by the decrees 01 1110 third Lateran 00011011111
1215, and especially by the Canons 01 1110 00011011 01 Oxford held
under Archbishop Langton in 1222. Τ110 13, 14, 15, 16 Canons
of this 00011011 lay down rules 101 1110 settlement 01 VicarageS.
The sum specified as a fitting maintenance 101· 1110 Vicar is five
marks, “except in Wales, where Vicars are content with less.’'
Before the holding of this 00011011, and after the date 01 1110 book
here printed, it is recorded in the Annals os Dunstable that Bishop
Hugh established five Vicarages in the Churches belonging to the
Dunstable 011110115ᾒθ 50 that it is probable that the Bishop continued
to prosecute this important work with vigour, as did his successor,
Grosseteste, and hence the bitter way in which both these Bishops
are spoken 01 by Matthew Paris, the monk 01 St. Alban's. Those
interested in the early records 01 the Anglican Church can hardly
fail to find much to gratify them in the curious records here given

of the foundation 01 50 many beneficos. G G P
