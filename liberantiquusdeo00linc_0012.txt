Lincoln, begun by St. Hugh, was carried. to completion by him.
The King gave him “quadraginta fusta in foresta de Sirewoocl ad.
aulam suam Lincolniae faciendam.’' ‘¹² Another hall was built at
Thorne. The Bishop's parks were stocked with deer. Strict
visitation articles (probably the earliest) were sent out through the
Diocese. The western transepts and nave of the Cathedral Church
advanced apace. The metrical Life of st. Huqh testifies to the
zeal of Hugh the Second :—

“ Hugonis
Perficietur opus primi sub Hugone Secundo.’'

By his will, dated. at Stow, 1233, Bishop Hugh gives 100 marks to
the fabric fund of the Cathedral, and. all the timber of which he

the Cathedral. Unquestionably the greatest work of this energetic
Bishop was that which is detailed in the following pages. How

gathered. from the sketch of the history of Vicarages here given,
for which the reader is indebted to the researches of Dr. Pegge, a
former Canon of Lincoln, and. a famous antiquary of the last
century.† Our parochia] 0110101105, he sayS, were at first all rectories,

license from the King and the Pope to be perpetual incumbents of
