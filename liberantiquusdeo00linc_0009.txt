THE Bishop, whose “ Vicarage Book ’⁷ is here printed, played a

not inconsiderable part in the history 01 1110 Church of
England in the stormy days of King John, and left his mark in
many ways both structura] and disciplinary on the Diocese of
Lincoln. Of his works the greatest and most valuable was the
general and formal rescue from monkish greed and selfishness of a
portion 01 1110 1111100 01 1110 0110101100 which by one method or
another 1110 “religious '’ had appropriated. This 110 effected by the
regular establishment 01 Vicarages. How Bishop Hugh was able
to do 11110, 0οᾶ 00 what foundation the arrangement was built,
will be explained below, where a sketch of the history 01 Vicarages
is given. But first we desire to say something 01 1110 personality
01 1110 Bishop. When the 10011111 curse of the Church was fulminated
by Pope Innocent against the realm of England, and was brought
to England by the Bishops 01 London, Ely, and worcester, it was
necessa-ry that it should be published in all the Dioceses. There
were three Bishops in the land-Rath and WeHS, N orwich, and
Winchester—who would not suffer it to be pubh'shed in their
Dioceses, and who thus held to the King rather than to the Pope.
The Diocese 01 Lincoln had been without a Bishop for two years,
since the death of William de Blois (May, 1206), and there would
therefore be no one to defend the clergy and the people from the
effects of the curse. Under these *circumstances the King
endeavoured to anticipate and ward off the mischief by issuing the
Letters Patent following :—“ The Kintho all clerks and laymen in
the Diocese 01 Lincoln. Greeting. Know ye that 110111 Monday
next before the F east 01 Εο0101 we have committed to William de
